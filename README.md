# Using-a-simple-NN-to-optimize-HVAC-power-consumption-at-a-grid-level

In the framework of the Skoltech's course Non-equilibrium processes in energy conversion, we simlated the consumption of the air condicioning of a small grid based on a simple Markovian desision model , then we used a simple full-conneccted neural network to optimize the power consumption (based in some consumer side flexibility criteria).
